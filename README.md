# Feedback Form 

This project is a simple feedback form application built with React.js and Firebase. 

It serves as a learning project :slightly_smiling_face: to explore and practice various concepts in React.js, including components, states, routing, and API integration with Firebase.

## Project Overview

The project aims to create a feedback form for a hypothetical event or session. Participants can submit their feedback, which is stored in a Firebase database.
Key features and technologies used in this project include:

- React.js for building the user interface.
- React Router for client-side routing to navigate between different pages.
- Firebase for real-time data storage and retrieval.
- React state management to capture and manage user input.

## Usage
- Access the feedback form through the navigation menu.
- Fill out the form with your feedback.
- Click the "Submit" button to store your feedback in the Firebase database.
- View submitted feedback in the table on the same page.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
