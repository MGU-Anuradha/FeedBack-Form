# Feedback Form 

This project is a simple feedback form application built with React.js and Firebase. 

It serves as a learning project :slightly_smiling_face: to explore and practice various concepts in React.js, including components, states, routing, and API integration with Firebase.

## Project Overview

The project aims to create a feedback form for a hypothetical event or session. Participants can submit their feedback, which is stored in a Firebase database.
Key features and technologies used in this project include:

- React.js for building the user interface.
- React Router for client-side routing to navigate between different pages.
- Firebase for real-time data storage and retrieval.
- React state management to capture and manage user input.

## Usage
- Access the feedback form through the navigation menu.
- Fill out the form with your feedback.
- Click the "Submit" button to store your feedback in the Firebase database.
- View submitted feedback in the table on the same page.
